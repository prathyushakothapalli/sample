<p>Native to Australia, cockatiels are small members of the parrot family known for the tuft of feathers on top of their head, called a crest. Cockatiels raise and lower their crests depending on their mood—raised when they are excited or curious and pressed flat against their heads when they are stressed. A relaxed cockatiel typically holds their crest feathers somewhere between raised and flat and may gently grind their beak when content.Native to Australia, cockatiels are small members of the parrot family known for the tuft of feathers on top of their head, called a crest.
