    Elizabeth meets Churchill to discuss Philip's requests to let Charles and Anne keep the Mountbatten surname and let the family continue living at Clarence House rather than move into Buckingham Palace. Churchill is reluctant to agree, and Elizabeth drops both matters after receiving counsel from Edward. She later learns her coronation has been set for the following year, recognising it as a deliberate move by Churchill to secure his position within the Conservative Party. Philip approaches Peter Townsend, George's former equerry, and convinces him to give flying lessons, unaware that Townsend is having an affair with Margaret.</summary>
