        <p>Pusarla Venkata Sindhu was born and brought up in Hyderabad, India to P. V. Ramana and P. Vijaya.[5][18] Ramana's ancestors belong to Eluru district of Andhra Pradesh and later moved to Guntur.[19][20] Ramana was an employee of the Indian Railways and was born in Nirmal. Vijaya hails from Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh.[19][21] Sindhu and her family regularly offer prayers to their family deity in Ratnalammakunta village of Eluru district.[22][23][24]

            Both her parents have been national level volleyball players. Her father, Ramana and was a member of the Indian volleyball team that won the bronze medal in the 1986 Seoul Asian Games, received the Arjuna Award in 2000 for his contribution to the sport.[25] Sindhu lives in Hyderabad. She was educated at Auxilium High School[26] and at St. Ann's College for Women, Hyderabad.[27] Though her parents played professional volleyball, she chose badminton over it because she drew inspiration from the success of Pullela Gopichand, the 2001 All England Open Badminton Champion.[28] She eventually started playing badminton from the age of eight.[25] She first learned the basics of the sport with the guidance of Mehboob Ali at the badminton courts of the Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications in Secunderabad. Soon after, she joined Pullela Gopichand's Gopichand Badminton Academy.[28] While profiling her career, a correspondent with The Hindu wrote:</p>
